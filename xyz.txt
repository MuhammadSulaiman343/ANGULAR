I will give you the description about the program I want to make in c# and will give you two examples of inputs and their output, the task is being performed on Coderbyte.com so their will be some hidden cases too, I will give you the sample code too which you will have to complete according to the instructions given and make sure the program you will write would handle the hidden cases and give optimal solution plus make sure the code should not be complex, it should be easy to understand and give the optimal solution
